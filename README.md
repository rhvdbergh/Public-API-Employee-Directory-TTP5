Techdegree Project 5

Ronald van der Bergh

This project uses an API (https://randomuser.me) to create a (mock) employee
directory of 12 employees for a (mock) company, Awesome Startup. The API returns
a JSON object, which is parsed. A modal window opens when the employee's name or image is
clicked. This modal window displays extra information.

No helper files were provided - the HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this project were all 
created from scratch, according to mockup .png files that were supplied.

For extra credit, a filter is added to filter search through employee names. Also, 
when the modal window is open, the user can move forwards or backwards to view other
employees.
